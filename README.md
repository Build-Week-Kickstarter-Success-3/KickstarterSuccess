## About Us
Jeremy Hebert, Jake Harris, Grant Ho, and Xiao Song completed optimized the previous work by Philip Lee, Rhia Goerge and Lucas Chatam on https://github.com/Build-Week-Kickstarter-Success-3. 

We optimized two features-- 

### 1. Drop-down menu feature
We implemented a drop-down menu feature that will allow prospective users to input their project category and subcategory options with more ease.   

### 2. Sub-Category Display Only Shows the Options Within the Category
We placed an additional callback to limit the display of subcategories to the corresponding category of projects.
